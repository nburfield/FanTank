              <p>Chancelor Johnathan Bennett (born April 16, 1993), known professionally as Chance the Rapper, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and philanthropist[3] from the West Chatham neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois.[4][5] In 2013, he began to gain recognition following the release of his second mixtape, Acid Rap.[6] Apart from his solo career, he is also a member of the Chicago collective Save Money (along with frequent collaborator Vic Mensa), and has worked as the lead vocalist for the band The Social Experiment. They released the widely lauded album Surf in May 2015.</p>
              
              <h2>Early Life</h2>
              
              <p>Bennett grew up in the middle-class neighborhood of West Chatham on Chicago's South Side. His younger brother, Taylor Bennett, is also a Chicago rapper.[8] His father, Ken Williams-Bennett, was an aide to former Chicago mayor Harold Washington and worked for then-Senator Barack Obama. Williams-Bennett, who is now a deputy chief of staff to Mayor Rahm Emanuel, dreamed that his son might one day hold office.[9] In his freshman year at Jones College Prep High School, Chance formed the hip-hop duo Instrumentality with a friend.[10] Many of Chance's earliest performances took place at the YOUmedia Lyricist Loft at Harold Washington Library in Chicago.[11] He mentioned in an interview that fellow Chicago native Kanye West's 2004 debut album The College Dropout was the first hip-hop album that he ever purchased and listened to, previously being into soul and jazz.[12]</p>
              
              <p>At Jones College Prep High School, some of his teachers ridiculed his aspirations to become a musician.[13] Following a 10-day suspension in early 2011 during his senior year for possessing marijuana on campus,[14] Bennett recorded his first full-length project, a mixtape titled 10 Day (also known as #10Day).[13][15][16] In December 2011, he released a song titled "Windows", and publicly announced his 10 Day project.[17] In February 2012, Bennett was highlighted as one of Complex magazine's "10 New Chicago Rappers to Watch Out For."[18] Bennett says he spent "about eight months recording, writing and making connections off of the hunger to put out something."[15] Bennett released the mixtape on April 3, 2012 and it has since been downloaded over 300,000 times via Datpiff.[15][19] The mixtape was well received locally and helped Bennett make connections with producers such as Chuck Inglish, Kenny Jame$, and Blended Babies.[15] The mixtape grabbed the attention of Forbes magazine, which featured it in the publication's Cheap Tunes column.</p>
              
              <h2>Career</h2>
              
              <p>In July 2012, Bennett appeared on American rapper Childish Gambino's sixth mixtape, Royalty, on the track, called "They Don't Like Me". Gambino asked Bennett to join on his first concert tour of North America as his opening act.[15][21][22] On April 30, 2013, Chance released his second mixtape, Acid Rap,[23] on DatPiff. Since the release of his mixtape, the record has been downloaded over one million times.[24] Chance enlisted the guest vocalists from Twista, Vic Mensa, Saba, BJ the Chicago Kid, Action Bronson, Childish Gambino and Ab-Soul.[25] Acid Rap was strongly praised by music critics and fans alike.[26] At Metacritic, the mixtape received an average score of 86, based on 21 critics, which indicates "universal acclaim."[27] It was also nominated for Best Mixtape at the 2013's BET Hip Hop Awards.[28] On May 6, 2013, after being featured as the hidden track on Acid Rap, which is a song, titled "Paranoia". The song was produced by Nosaj Thing, and it was released as a contribution to Yours Truly and Adidas originals "Songs from Scratch" series.</p>
              
              <p>In June 2013, Bennett was featured in a commercial for MySpace as part of their relaunch, alongside fellow American rappers Mac Miller, Pharrell Williams and Schoolboy Q, among others.[30] In July 2013, Acid Rap debuted at number 63 on the Billboard's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, due to downloads on iTunes and Amazon.[31] In August 2013, Bennett performed at the Chicago music festival Lollapalooza.[32] Acid Rap was listed on multiple 50 best albums of 2013 lists, including 26th for Rolling Stone,[33] 12th on Pitchfork's list,[34] and ranked 4th by Complex.[35] It was also listed as one of NPR Music's 50 Favorite Albums of 2013.[36] Chance embarked on his Social Experiment Tour, in Champaign, Illinois on October 25, 2013, lasting until December 19, 2013.[37] He was also a featured artist on Childish Gambino's album, Because the Internet, which was released on December 6, 2013.</p>
